# FikaApp 🚌

**FikaApp** is a simple, user-friendly transit timetable viewer built with **JavaScript**. It aims to make accessing and understanding public transport schedules—like those of MyCiTi Bus and Golden Arrow—much

- 🔁 **Route Direction Toggle**: Flip between outbound and return directions for any route using a convenient radio button.
- 🧭 **Cleaner UI**: No more sifting through PDF documents—FigaApp presents the data in a clean and readable format.
- 🚌 **Current Support**: Currently displays **MyCiTi Bus** timetables.
- 🛠️ **Coming Soon**: Integration of **Golden Arrow** and **train** schedules.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React/JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

## 📦 Future Plans
